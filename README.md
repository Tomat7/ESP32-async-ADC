# ESP32-async-ADC
ESP32 non-blocking ADC functions

 ALL CODE BELOW WAS "STOLEN" FROM ORIGINAL REPOSITORY https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
 
 Functions adcStart/adcBusy/adcEnd was removed after 1.0.4 RELEASE of "Arduino core for the esp32".
 But these functions are very useful for "ASYNC" and "NO-WAIT" ADC reading.
 I just copied code from Realease 1.0.4 of ESP32 Arduino to use it in my library.
